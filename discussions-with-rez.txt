Docker hands-on:
 * networking should be shown as well
 * example could be to run a tomcat and a mysql DB in two separate containers and just deploy our app to tomcat, such as in a testing environment
 * Show slides (10 min)
 * Demo (35 min)
 ** Dockerfile (15 min)
 ** Docker CLI (20 min)
 * Step-by-step hands-on exercise (connecting two microservices - DB, tomcat, 25 min)
